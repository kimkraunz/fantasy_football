# Fantasy Football- using a Bayesian approach to predict a fantasy football team

##This continues to be a work in process

Here's where I am in the process

1. Scrape weekly projections from ESPN, FantasySharks, Fantasy Football Today, Numberfire, FantasyPros, and NFL [**DONE**](https://github.com/kimkraunz/fantasy_football/tree/master/R_scripts/projections)

2. Convert projects to projected FanDuel fantasy points. **NOT DONE**

3. Match player names to create a master dataset.  **NOT DONE**

4. Create a normal distribution based on the mean and standard deviation of projected points for each player. **NOT DONE**

5. Create an optimatization engine to find the optimal fantasy football team.  **DONE**

6. Check accuracy of projections against actual points.  **NOT DONE**

7. Check interweek variability of players.  **NOT DONE**
